Content description
====================

'Main.m': file that sets up the path and configure plot (provided for convenience, its use is optional)

'FractionalDifferentialEquation.m': this MATLAB code solves a fractional differential equation using a discrete diffusive representation. It is associated with the following publication:
    F. Monteghetti, D. Matignon, E. Piot. Time-local discretization of 
    fractional and related diffusive operators using Gaussian quadrature 
    with applications (In revision, 2018)

'fun': folder than contains functions used in the script 'FractionalDifferentialEquation.m'.
